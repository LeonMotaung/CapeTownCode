## 💡 Repository Structure

The code is organized into clear, top-level directories based on the technology stack. Simply navigate to the folder corresponding to the tutorial series you are watching:

| Directory | Core Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`./mern-stack/`** | JavaScript, Node.js, React | Projects covering the MERN stack: building REST APIs, front-end components, and full-stack web apps. |
| **`./python-ai-ml/`** | Python, Data Science, AI/ML | Scripts for data cleaning, visualization, machine learning model training (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn), and AI concepts. |
| **`./java-mastery/`** | Core Java, OOP | Fundamentals of Java programming, Object-Oriented Principles (OOP), and foundational Java projects. |

**Important:** Every individual project folder within these directories includes its own `README.md` file detailing prerequisites, setup instructions, and execution commands.
